# DigitalCrafts Solo React Project - LostPals

## App: Lost Pals - a lost pet reporting website

app link: https://www.lostpals.one/

##Disclaimer:

As of now all images uploaded by the user will be purged whenever the server restarts.

## App Description:

This app is used for reporting lost pets. It allows users to view all pets reported missing, register their own pets and report them if they get lost. It also provides users with some resources for pet travel gear and pet emergency plan in case of natural disasters.

## Motivation:

Losing a beloved pet can be very stressful and a simple poster on a street corner will often go unnoticed. I wanted to provide a better way to get this information out to the world. By accessing a community of other concerned pet owners, users can report a lost pet to a wider, more vigilant audience and increase the likelyhood of recovering their pet.

## Features:

A custom built API allows users to upload an image of their pet along with thier pet's information and store it in a PostgreSQL database. Users can also comment on lost pet post with any information they might be able to provide.
